# ExpressionEngine Gist plugin

This ExpressionEngine Plug-in can be used to display gists.

_Compatibility_

- It works on EE2.
- It is expected to work on EE3.
- It _might_ work on EE4+ but that hasn't been tested.

## How to Use

Place the gist folder in `./system/expressionengine/third_party/`.

`{exp:gist:fetch id='gistId' file='fileName'}`

The id is required and the file is an optional paramater. If the file is supplied only the requested file will be retured.
